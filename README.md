		a) python install requests	
		b) pip install requests	
		c) install requests	
		d) python setup.py install

17.	A user has installed Python using the latest stable version and needs to check the interpreter path to configure their IDE. Which operating system tool is used to find the location of the installed Python executable?
		a) ls -l	
		b) which python (Linux/macOS) or where python (Windows)	
		c) cd /	
		d) check_interpreter()

19.	When preparing a system for Python installation, identifying system requirements (hardware/software) helps prevent which potential issue?
		a) Over-allocation of memory to the Python interpreter.	
		b) Errors during installation due to incompatibility.	
		c) Security vulnerabilities in the Python standard library.	
		d) The incorrect selection of Python tools.

21.	You are instructed to configure a Python virtual environment. The primary purpose of this action is to:
		a) Increase the execution speed of Python scripts.	
		b) Isolate project dependencies from the global Python installation.	
		c) Provide advanced debugging features not available in a standard installation.	
		d) Enable the use of different text editors for the same project.

23.	The curriculum lists Text editor, Python, and IDE as required tools. Which task is best suited for an IDE over a basic text editor?
		a) Writing simple, single-line Python commands.	
		b) Opening and reading a plain text file for data processing.	
		c) Managing complex project debugging, version control integration, and code refactoring.	
		d) Running the python --version command from a terminal.

25.	You need to manage two projects: Project A requires Python 3.8 and library X, while Project B requires Python 3.10 and library Y (which conflicts with X). The most effective way to manage this on a single machine is by:
		a) Installing both libraries globally and hoping for no conflicts.	
		b) Using a specific virtual environment for each project.
		c) Reinstalling Python entirely whenever switching projects.	
		d) Using only one Python version for both projects.

27.	After testing a Python installation with python --version, you want to ensure the pip package manager is also functional. Which action confirms this?
		a) Running pip check to see if a package manager object is returned.	
		b) Attempting to install a dummy package and checking the output logs for success or failure.
		c) Checking the system PATH variable for "pip".	
		d) Running check pip status in the command line.

29.	Which of the following is a potential security measure to implement when integrating Python scripts for system automation?
		a) Restricting script access and controlling sensitive information.	
		b) Storing all credentials in plain text within the script files.	
		c) Running all automation scripts with root/administrator privileges by default.	
		d) Disabling all logging and notification features during execution.

31.	To successfully run existing scripts developed for a Windows environment on a Linux machine, a crucial initial step involves checking the shebang line and file permissions. The required command to make a script named automate.py executable in Linux is:
		a) run automate.py	
		b) python run automate.py	
		c) chmod +x automate.py	
		d) execute automate.py

33.	When preparing an environment for a project that requires significant numerical computation (e.g., in data analysis), which library from the indicative content would you prioritize installing first after setting up the virtual environment? 
		a) Matplotlib	
		b) NumPy	
		c) Pandas	
		d) Arrow

35.	Scenario: A networking team has a core set of Python automation scripts developed over the last five years using Python 2.7. The organization is mandating a migration to the latest Python 3 version due to security and support concerns. Analyze the technical challenges and potential conflicts they will likely encounter during this migration process, specifically focusing on environment setup, library compatibility, and core language syntax changes.
36.	Scenario: You are a system architect tasked with deciding the deployment environment for a new Python-based application that manages real-time network traffic data. You must evaluate two potential options: a traditional local server installation with a global Python environment versus a containerized (e.g., Docker) deployment using virtual environments. Justify which option provides a more stable, reproducible, and scalable environment, citing security and dependency management benefits.
37.	Task: Create a detailed plan (workflow) for a junior IT technician to prepare, install, and test a robust Python environment for the "Networking and Internet Technologies" course. The plan must incorporate a checklist for identifying system requirements, the exact command-line steps for creating and configuring a isolated virtual environment, and verification steps using specific terminal commands to ensure a successful setup as outlined in the curriculum.
